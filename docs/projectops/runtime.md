# Running ProjectOps with PostgreSQL

Requires Node 22.6+ (Node 22 recommended), pnpm and PostgreSQL 16+. The runtime protects ProjectOps pages and APIs with operator sessions. It is not yet deployed.

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
export DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/projectops'
pnpm operator:create < operator.json
pnpm start
```

Keep actual credentials outside git. Configure PostgreSQL TLS through the connection URL; certificate verification is not disabled by application code. HOST defaults to 127.0.0.1 and PORT to 3000. The database must already exist. Provision once using a private JSON input file with `login` and `password` fields, a password of at least 12 characters, and file permissions 0600. Keep the file outside the repository and delete it after provisioning. The command never overwrites an existing operator. Open /projectops/login to sign in, /projectops for the summary dashboard, and /projectops/settings to change credentials or defaults; API routes are under /projectops. SIGINT/SIGTERM close the HTTP server and database pool.

Startup applies the frozen migration artifacts in a transaction and records their names/checksums in projectops_schema_migrations. Concurrent startup is serialized. Subsequent startup verifies and skips applied versions. Do not edit an applied artifact; add and register the next version. Startup refuses existing ProjectOps tables without a ledger: back up and prepare an explicit legacy migration before using such a database.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm verify
export PROJECTOPS_TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgres://user:password@127.0.0.1:5432/projectops_test'
pnpm test:postgres
```

The PostgreSQL acceptance command fails if its URL is missing. It creates unique test schemas and removes only those schemas afterward. Use a dedicated test database and a role allowed to create schemas. It checks API writes and dashboard reads across application restart, simultaneous migration startup, a new migration version, checksum drift, transactional rollback and unmanaged-schema refusal. GitHub Actions runs it against PostgreSQL 16.

## Operator access

The current boundary has one operator identity, matching the operator access slice. No public registration or team account model is introduced. Passwords use the foundation's salted scrypt hashing. Opaque sessions store only a SHA-256 token hash in PostgreSQL, expire after eight hours or thirty minutes idle, and survive application restart. Logout revokes the current session; changing credentials requires the current password and revokes every session. Login and credential verification share a persistent limit of ten attempts per minute. Account recovery and team permissions are not implemented by this slice.

For external access, set PUBLIC_ORIGIN to the exact HTTPS origin (for example https://projectops.example.com), terminate TLS at your trusted proxy, and configure HOST appropriately. Forwarded headers never select the origin. Non-loopback binding without HTTPS PUBLIC_ORIGIN is rejected. HTTP cookies are allowed only for loopback development; external sessions use a Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict host cookie. Every write requires the configured Origin, application/json, and the session's x-csrf-token header. Login requires Origin and JSON as well. Obtain the CSRF token from GET /projectops/access/session after login; never store the session token in browser local storage.

Settings persist currency, priority and an IANA timezone. New project requests use the saved priority when omitted; estimates use the saved currency when omitted. Explicit values still win and are validated. Timezone is retained for later workspace display; existing stored timestamps remain ISO UTC. Currency settings do not fix mixed-currency dashboard totals, which belong to the finances slice.

Browser acceptance runs a real Chromium journey against PostgreSQL:

```bash
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps chromium
pnpm test:browser
```

Real database acceptance also checks upgrading the previous schema without losing client records, hashed credential/session storage, persisted settings and sessions, session expiry, revocation, credential changes, and persistent rate limits. The application factory without access is a contract-test harness; the PostgreSQL runtime always enables access.
